## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue:

1. Do not open a public issue.
2. Send a private report with:
   - impact summary
   - reproduction steps
   - affected version(s)
   - suggested remediation (if available)
3. Include proof-of-concept data that is safe and sanitized.

## Response expectations

- Initial acknowledgment target: 3 business days
- Triage target: 7 business days
- Fix timeline depends on severity and exploitability

## Scope notes
